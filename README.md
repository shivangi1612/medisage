# 🧠 MediSage: AI-Powered Lab Report Analyzer

This project uses **Gemini AI** and **LangChain** to extract, interpret, and summarize information from **lab test reports** (PDF or image). It provides patients with an easy-to-understand health summary using advanced AI capabilities, and a smart chatbot for follow-up health questions.

🔄 Fully Automated Pipeline: From OCR-based text extraction to AI-powered lab result interpretation and natural language summary—everything happens in a single workflow with minimal user input.

🧠 Powered by Gemini + LangChain: Leverages Google's Gemini models through LangChain for accurate extraction and personalized summaries, with logic layers for interpretation based on medical reference ranges.

📦 Plug-and-Play for Health Apps: Designed to be modular and easily integrated into telemedicine platforms, personal health apps, or electronic health record (EHR) systems.
